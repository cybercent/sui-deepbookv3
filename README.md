## Quick Start

Here are some example use cases:

### Check Account Open Orders
```rust
use sui_deepbookv3::client::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::new().await;
    let orders = client.get_account_open_orders().await;
    println!("Open orders: {:?}", orders);
}
```

### Query Level2 Order Book
```rust 
use sui_deepbookv3::client::Client;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::new().await;
    let level2_data = client.get_level2_book_status(0, 10).await;
    println!("Order book depth: {:?}", level2_data);
}
```
